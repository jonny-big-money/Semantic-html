                 <p>Several supervised machine learning models have been proposed and used to detect Android ransomware. These models were
                trained using different datasets from different sources. However, the age of the ransomware datasets was not considered
                when training and testing these models. Therefore, the detection accuracy for those models is inaccurate since</p>

              <p>Most severe malicious applications is Android ransomware, which steals data and encrypts it, where users have only one
